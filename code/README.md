# Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you haven't already, you can download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once Node.js is installed, follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `code/base-project` directory.
3. Run the following command to install project dependencies:
```
npm install
```
This command will download and install all the dependencies listed in the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections of the `package.json` file.

4. After the dependencies are installed, transpile the TypeScript code by running the following command:
```
npx tsc
```
This command will compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript.

5. Finally, run the project by executing the following command:
```
node transpiled_js/unoplat-cli.js - this content
```
